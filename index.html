	<p>In November of 2016, Massachusetts residents voted on the legalization of marijuana, controversially passing the measure by a little over 50%. As the first state on the East Coast to legalize the purchase of the drug, the Bay State became a trailblazer, with many people waiting to see how the measure would pan out. Now, five years and a global pandemic later, hereâ€™s how the cannabis industry, and attitudes towards it, have changed in Massachusetts.</p>

	<p>Since the law was signed into legislation, the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commision, created in 2017, has approved almost 1000 applications for marijuana establishment licenses. Out of those applications, 387 of them were for retail business, and 296 were for marijuana cultivation, together making up two thirds of the licenses.</p>




	<p>As more businesses pop up, the state has seen a shift in attitude towards recreational use of the drug. Originally, the law passed with an approval rating of 54%, according to the <a href="http://electionstats.state.ma.us/ballot_questions/search/year_from:1972/year_to:2016"> Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth</a>. However, that rating seems to have significantly increased in the past five years. In a <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/CovidSchoolsPoliciesToplines.pdf">recent poll taken last month</a>, the University of Massachusetts Amherst reported that 86% believe legalization of marijuana has not had a negative effect, with 61% saying it has had an overall positive impact on the state. </p>

	<p>One positive impact of commercial sale of marijuana is the economic benefits it creates. Specifically, the tax revenue for the state was initially a huge draw for supporting legalization. And while the state has collected millions of dollars in taxes since 2018 when business started opening, the number has fallen short of projection because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only in its infancy, the state's cannabis industry was curbed by the Pandemic shut-down, turning out unexpected numbers. However, many people seem to believe the industry will bounce back and set course for original predictions.  </p>

	<p>As for other effects, there has been a noticeable shift in people's attitudes towards marijuana use. Joe Benga, a representative of the dispensary Happy Valley Ventures in Gloucester, MA, believes that the legalization of cannabis in the state has decreased stigmatization in recreational use of the drug, especially in older generations. Benga says that the majority age demographic for their customers at Happy Valley are people ages 50 and older, who feel more comfortable trying cannabis products now that they are more common. After all, the drug is known for <a href="https://health.ucsd.edu/news/releases/Pages/2020-10-07-study-finds-older-adults-using-cannabis-to-treat-common-health-conditions.aspx"> easing pain and mental issues</a>, such as anxiety and insomnia. </p>

	<p>According to Benga, their most popular product is edibles, which is food or beverage infused with marjuana, a healthier form of consumption as opposed to smoking, and much safer for older individuals. </p>

	<p>However, data from the Cannabis Control Commission found the most popular form of marijuana legally purchased in Massachusetts to be bud, the dried out clumps of flower from a cannabis plant. It is often ground up and smoked. Edibles was the third most popular, after marijuana for vapes, which are cartridges that hold a liquid form of marijuana, also ingested through smoking it. </p>

	<img class="graphic" src="PieChart.png">

	<p>This data makes sense as people ages 18-29 are <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/284135/percentage-americans-smoke-marijuana.aspx
	"> most likely to smoke weed</a>, an age range that accounts for 14% of Massachusetts' population. This age range, consisting of both Millennials and Generation Z, is one of the biggest age populations in the state, according to the Massachusetts Census Reporter.</p>

	<p>Of course, it remains illegal for adults under the age of 21 to purchase or consume weed and CBD products. But those of age can now do so without worry of repercussions. In recent years, Massachusetts residents have been calling to expunge past convictions of marijuana dealings, and while it is possible, the process is difficult, costly, and not entirely guaranteed to be successful. Some states have automatically cleared records of marijuana convictions, but it seems legislators are not keen on a measure to that extent quite yet, despite public support.</p>

	<p>What else is on the frontier of the Massachusetts cannabis industry? Perhaps state leaders will decide to focus on increasing the retail side of the law. States like California and Colorado have cannabis cafes where guests can smoke weed freely and order menu items infused with THC and CBD. According to <a href="https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2021/12/09/massachusetts-cannabis-cafes/">Boston Magazine</a>, there are plans drawn up for places like this in the city, but the current law still prohibits social consumption businesses like restaurants and cafes. While Massachusetts legislators have made big steps toward progressive marijuana use, they are by no means quick about it. While there is plenty of support within the state house, still no vote has come to pass to expand the law even further.</p>
